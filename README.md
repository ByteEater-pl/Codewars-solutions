Each file has the cata ID from the URI as its name, followed by a language appropriate extension for GitHub to recognize.

Example
-
Kata URI: //www.codewars.com/kata/51675d17e0c1bed195000001

file name: 51675d17e0c1bed195000001.hs

In cases I submitted multiple solutions to the same kata, the oldest one follows the pattern above and the others are given in chronological order subsequent natural numbers starting from 1 as additional penultimate extensions.

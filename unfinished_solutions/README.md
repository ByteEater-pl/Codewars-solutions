I've finished and put the C++ solutions in the repo's root. As for the rest, I'm convinced now that some are bugs in either Codewars itself or test suites for the katas for the particular language. One case might be diffferent: `5811199ae10b5341ed00010d`. It seems obvious to me that the query is correct, yet one test fails. I haven't investigated the output very thoroughly. It's included in the commit message for `5811199ae10b5341ed00010d.sql`.

Codewars calls these unfinished solutions. In some cases it seems that I simply forgot to press Submit (to which the button label changes if all the tests pass) after Attempt. One is marked as Retired. Plan to investigate.
